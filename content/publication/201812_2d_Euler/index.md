abstract: 'We prove two results of strong continuity with respect to the initial datum
for bounded solutions to the Euler equations in vorticity form. The first result provides
sequential continuity and holds for a general bounded solution. The second result provides
uniform continuity and is restricted to HÂ¨older continuous solutions.'
