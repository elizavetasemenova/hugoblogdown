I am a Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford in the Department of Computer Science working on scalable and flexible methods for spatiotemporal statistics and Bayesian machine learning with applications in epidemiology. I work with [Seth Flaxman](https://mlgh.net/author/seth-flaxman/), as well as the wider [Machine Learning & Global Health](https://mlgh.net/author/seth-flaxman/) Network. Currently, my focus is on using deep generative modelling to power MCMC inference in classical spatial statistics, as well as adaptive survey design.

Previously, I was at Imperial College London, Departament of Mathematics, Statistics section (2021-2022) and did a postdoc in Bayesian Machine Learning at AstraZeneca R&D (2019-2021) where I also collaborated with [Prioris.ai](https://prioris.ai/). My research there was dedicated to toxicity prediction and concentration-response curve fitting of large molecules. 

In 2019 I completed a PhD in Epidemiology at the Swiss TPH, where I worked on modelling of point patterns using Log-Gaussian Cox Process and detection of hotspots on gridded surfaces. 

I am also passionate about community building, diversity and inclusion. I have initiated and participated in a number of outreach activities, creating equitable access and opportunties in education, research and technology.
