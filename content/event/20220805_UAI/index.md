I presented some recent advances in Bayesian spatial modelling at the [5th Workshop on Tractable Probabilistic Modeling](https://tractable-probabilistic-modeling.github.io/tpm2022/index.html) of the Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) conference. Many thanks to the organisers for the invitation and their hard work!
